PART 4: UPDATE EXISTING COMPONENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. UPDATE DESKTOP NEWS COMPONENT:

Change from:
```typescript
const newsData = [...]
```

To:
```typescript
import newsData from '@/data/news.json';

// Use newsData.news instead of newsData
```

2. UPDATE MOBILE NEWS CAROUSEL:

Change from:
```typescript
import activitiesData from '@/data/activities.json';
```

To:
```typescript
import newsData from '@/data/news.json';

// Use newsData.news
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 5: CONFIGURATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. UPDATE next.config.ts:

Add image domains:
```typescript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    // Existing patterns...
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: 'textiletoday.com.bd',
    },
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: 'textilefocus.com',
    },
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: 'imglink.io',
    },
  ],
}
```

2. ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:

In .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
(Change to production URL when deploying)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 6: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Run these commands:
```bash
npm install gray-matter remark remark-html
npm install react-infinite-scroll-component
npm install react-share
npm install @types/react-share --save-dev
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TESTING CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After implementation, verify:

/news page:
- [ ] Grid layout displays correctly (3-2-1 columns)
- [ ] All news cards show proper data
- [ ] Infinite scroll loads more items
- [ ] Cards have hover effects
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Responsive on all screen sizes
- [ ] Links to individual articles work

/news/[slug] page:
- [ ] Hero image displays full width
- [ ] Article content renders from markdown
- [ ] Metadata displays correctly (date, author, read time, tags)
- [ ] Share buttons work (Facebook, LinkedIn, Copy)
- [ ] Related news shows correct articles
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation works
- [ ] Typography looks good
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] SEO meta tags present
- [ ] Open Graph tags correct
- [ ] Structured data in HTML

General:
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Dark theme consistent
- [ ] Smooth animations
- [ ] Fast page loads
- [ ] Images optimized

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IMPORTANT NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Slugs are auto-generated from titles but stored in JSON for consistency
2. Markdown files should match the contentFile value in JSON
3. All external images require domains in next.config.ts
4. Infinite scroll loads 9 items initially, then 6 more each time
5. Related news shows max 3 articles with matching tags
6. Share buttons require NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL to be set
7. Structured data improves SEO and search appearance
8. Article pages are statically generated for better performance
9. Dark theme and existing design language maintained throughout
10. Mobile-first responsive design approach

MIGRATION STRATEGY:

1. Create all new files first
2. Test with one article before creating all markdown files
3. Update existing components last
4. Verify all routes work before pushing to production

Please implement this complete news system with all features, ensuring responsive design, proper SEO, and maintaining the existing dark theme aesthetic.
