    "testimony": "From the very beginning, the vision of the AATCC AUST Student Chapter was to guide students beyond the boundaries of traditional learning. We worked to make students more creativity-driven and technically strong, not just shaped to fit into a corporate routine. Through factory visits, lab exposure, national and international textile workshops, and research initiatives, we showed that textiles were far more than just the RMG sector. We aimed to broaden horizons, nurture innovation, and support pathways for research. At its heart, the chapter became a community where students dreamed bigger, thought deeper, and shaped the future of textiles with knowledge and imagination."
